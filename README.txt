# Term-Project

Hi! Welcome to Nitro Type Elite! 

NitroType Elite is a typing race where users are given a random chunk of text, 
and are required to type it as fast and as accurately as possible. 
In this race, the typing speed of the user will be represented by a car 
traversing through a maze. At the end of the race, the users words per minute(WPM) 
and typing accuracy will be displayed, as well as their record WPM and record 
accuracy. Happy racing! 

Running the project + shortcuts: 
Running NitroType Elite is simple! Once the user has the "tirumalai-tp" file open on VSCode, 
they can hit "Command B", and then press either "Start" to start a race, "Reset" to set all 
of the best accuracy and best WPM records to 0, or "Info" to learn how to play. 
Once the race is over, the user will be prompted to either start another race, "reset" the
statistics from their previous races, go to "info" mode again, or quit the game entirely. 

External Libraries: 
Some external libraries used are the math library, the random library, the Image library, 
as well as os. These have all been imported in the beginning of the main python file. 

Shortcut commands: 
There are no shortcut commands besides "Command B" to run the code! Note: when typing the
randomly generated paragraphs, users must use shift for uppercase letters as opposed to 
the Caps Lock button. Also, if the shift and space button are pressed simultaneously, you
will be able to see the verticies of each object drawn on the screen. If this happens, 
just press shift and space simultaneously again to revert back to normal :)
